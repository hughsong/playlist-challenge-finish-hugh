# playlist-project-hugh

Host:
	backend is hosted on port 5000
	frontend is hosted on port 3000

we need open two terminals and npm start both of them

there are some imgs to introduce this web

npm install should be done inside my-play-list folder  to get node-module


Note:
I did not do any change on the backend,
so you can just download your original playlist-challenge-hugh and host it as backend
